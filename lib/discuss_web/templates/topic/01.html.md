## Why Read This Blog?

If you are new, or relatively new to web development and coding in general, you will have plenty of questions. You will hit brick walls, and spend more time then expected on pushing through them. There a plenty of ways to get help: Google, StackOverflow, YouTube, etc. All of these are great.

But what if you want hear from others like you, and not get bogged down in content that might be too technical for your level of experience? What if you want to discuss how to make choices on technologies, packages, coding patterns, etc? Are there valuable resources that you don't know about? Or do you just want to read about my trials as I work my way through my latest project? I am not an expert on anything, and I will be discussing my mistakes and discoveries, which you can learn from. I discuss what works for me, too.
